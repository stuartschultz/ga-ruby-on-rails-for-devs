Advanced Active Record
======================

The following features of ActiveRecord allow advanced functionality on top of the basic persistence capabilities.

Callbacks and Observers
-----------------------

Built-in callbacks, such as `before_validation`, allow participating in the object's lifecycle. Callbacks are instance methods.

``` ruby
class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  after_save :saved

  def saved
    Rails.logger.log "created Widget with id=#{id} and name=#{name}"
  end

  before_create do |widget|
    widget.name = widget.name.capitalize
  end
end
```

You can also create observers that derive from `ActiveRecord::Observer` that `observe Model` and implement callbacks, such as `after_create`.

``` ruby
class WidgetObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
  def after_save(model)
    Rails.logger.log "created Widget with id=#{model.id} and name=#{model.name}"
  end
end
```

You must register your observers in the application's *config/application.rb*.

``` ruby
config.active_record.observers = :widget_observer
```

Transactions
------------

``` ruby
Model.transaction do
   # wraps commands within a transaction
end
```

Single Table Inheritance
------------------------

Rails allows one to have multiple classes based off of a single table, using the type column to determine the class.

    $ rails g migration add_type_to_gadgets type:string

Generates the following *db/schema.rb*:

``` ruby
create_table "gadgets" do |t|
  t.string   "type"  # type defines the class this row belongs to (HeaderGadget, SidebarGadget, etc)
  t.string   "name"
  t.datetime "created_at"
  t.datetime "updated_at"
end
```

Based on the string in the type column, one of the following classes would get instantiated.

``` ruby
class Gadget; end;

class MusicGadget
  def playlist
    # retrieves music playlist
  end
end

class SidebarGadget
  def dock
    # docks the gadget to a particular bar
  end
end
```

This allows one to vary functionality based on a type, but still have common persistence.

Again, [convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) is being practiced here, with the *type* column being reserved for STI. You should rarely if ever override the *type* column for something other than STI.

Polymorphic Associations
------------------------

Polymorphic relationships are created between objects that belong to multiple models.

``` ruby
class WebPage < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :widgets, as: :displayable
end

class Desktop < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :widgets, as: :displayable
end

class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :displayable, polymorphic: true
end
```

To enable this scenario, the polymorphic interface *Widget* must define both a foreign key column and a type column.

``` ruby
create_table "widgets", :force => true do |t|
  t.string   "name"
  t.datetime "created_at"
  t.datetime "updated_at"
  t.integer "displayable_id"
  t.string "displayable_type"
end
```

When to Use Them
----------------

* Polymorphic Associations (separate classes, multiple tables)
* Single Table Inheritance (separate classes, one table)
* Single Class with conditionals (one class, one table)

Gems of Interest
----------------

``` ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'fabrication'
  gem 'ffaker'
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
end
```

Points of Interest
-----------------

1. Rails [migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html)
    - `$ rails g migration add_gadgets_to_widgets gadget_id:integer`
2. `belongs_to`, `has_many`, and [`:through`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html)
    - `has_many :controls, through: :gadgets`
3. Using the object mother gem [`fabrication`](http://fabricationgem.org/) with gem [`ffaker`](https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/ffaker) to create fake data
    - `Fabricate(:widget)`
4. Testing associations and validations with ['rspec-rails'](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails) and the gem [`shoulda-matchers`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)
    -  `it {should validate_presence_of :type } `
5. [ActiveRecord Callbacks](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html): `before_validation`, `after_validation`, `before_save`, etc
6. [Single Table Inheritance](http://code.alexreisner.com/articles/single-table-inheritance-in-rails.html) using the `type` column
7. [Polymorphic Associations](http://railscasts.com/episodes/154-polymorphic-association) with the `displayable_id` and `displayable_type` column
