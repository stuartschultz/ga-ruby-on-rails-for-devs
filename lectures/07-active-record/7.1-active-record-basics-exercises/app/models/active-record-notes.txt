RAILS ACTIVE RECORD DATA CRUD NOTES

* To open the rails console to be able to CRUD data, type "rails c" or "bundle exec rails c"

* To create an object, invoke the class
eg. To create a project, you would use the Project class

* To create a object but not save, you do Class.new
eg. Project.new

* To add criteria to the object, throw it in within parenthesis
eg. Project.new(name: "Alpha")

* To get the last record pulled, you type "_"
eg. p = _

* To save to the database you could do the variable.save!
eg. p.save!

* If you have two different models and create a join table to join the two of them, to add something to the join table (let's say employees and projects), you would create an employee and save it to a variable ("e"), then create a project and save it to a variable ("p"). Next, you would do e.projects << p and ActiveRecord will automatically add a record to the join table. Then if you reload e and p, the relationship will be there and you can do e.projects and p.employees to see what's there

* To delete a relationship between project and employees, delete it from the join table (model)
