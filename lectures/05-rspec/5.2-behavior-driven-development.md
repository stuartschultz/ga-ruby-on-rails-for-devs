Behavior Driven Development with RSpec
======================================

Before we dive into Behavior Driven Development or *BDD*, let's refresh ourselves on what we know about Test Driven Development (*TDD*).

What is Test Driven Development?
--------------------------------

*Test Driven Development* is a software development process that relies on writing automated tests first, and then following up with writing the implementation. This process is often referred to as *Red-Green-Refactor*:

What is Behavior Driven Development?
------------------------------------

Dan North ran into the following when perform TDD ([source](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/))

"_I had a problem. While using and teaching agile practices like test-driven development (TDD) on projects in different environments, I kept coming across the same confusion and misunderstandings. 
Programmers wanted to know_

1. **where to start**,
2. **what to test and what not to test**,
3. **how much to test in one go**,
4. **what to call their tests**,
5. _and how to understand_ **why a test fails**."

He devised the technique *Behavior Driven Development* to help answer those questions during development.

Core Tenets of BDD
------------------

1. Test method names should be sentences written in a natural language
    - Understandable by non-developers, leveraging the [_ubiquitous language_](http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/132) of the domain. Everyone uses the same nomenclature.
    - Test names are whole sentences that include an `actor` and start with the word `should`.
    - Written in order of business value.
2. Emphasize behavior over testing
    - Solves the difficult question, "What to test?"
    - Defines an expected set a behavior, not a fine grained set of tests that could still result in incorrect behavior.
    - Helps instill focus on what should be made.
3. Every story should have a user facing acceptance criteria. `Outside-in` testing.
    - Stakeholders should be able to accept the story using some interface.
    - Allows for quick feedback from stakeholders on whether or not the assumptions about the behavior are correct.
    - Encourages [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it).

The Flow of BDD
---------------

Given no existing code, the typical flow of a story implemented via the BDD process is as follows:

1. Write `request spec` (aka acceptance spec)
2. Run `request spec`, and watch it go red
3. Write view implementation disregarding some non existent dependencies (ie: a controller or model doesn't exist)
4. Run `request spec`, and watch it go red
    1. Write `controller spec`, and dive `outside-in` to the application
    2. Run `controller spec`, and watch it go red.
    3. Write as much controller implementation as possible while having disregard for a non-existent model.
    4. Run `controller spec`, and watch it go red.
        1. Write `model spec`, and dive `outside-in` to the application.
        2. Run `model spec`, and watch it go red.
        3. Implement `model`.
        4. Run `model spec`, and watch it go green.
    13. Run `controller spec`, and watch it go green.
14. Run `request spec`, and watch it go green.
15. You're done!

In the real world, you'll have refactoring steps in between. But this outline shows how you start outside the application as an actor, and dive into the implementation details, writing tests on the way.

BDD in Action
-------------

We start off by writing the specification, or `spec`, that defines the behavior of a particular piece of the application.
This particular behavior is described in a `story` and once completed, is either accepted or rejected by the product owner.
`BDD` by its very nature is an `Outside-in` approach to testing since often times an external facing value is what must be spec'ed and accepted for the story to be completed.

Example story:

    *As a User*, I should be able to create a post, *given* that I am signed in.

Notice how the spec involves an actor, `User`, that performs an action. 
Starting from the outside, from the perspective of the actor, we write a request spec (or acceptance spec) to test this behavior with `RSpec` and `capybara`.

``` ruby
feature "user" do
  before do
    sign_in
  end

  scenario "should be able to post" do
    visit root_path
    click_on "create post"

    page.current_address.should == new_post_path

    title = Faker::Lorem.word
    content = Faker::Lorem.paragraph

    fill_in "post_title", with: title
    fill_in "post_content", with: content

    click_on "Create Post"

    post = Post.last
    page.current_path.should == post_path(post)
    page.should have_content content
    page.should have_content title
  end
end
```

With our spec complete, we run the test and begin our process of *Red-Green-Refactor*, except for this particular spec, we will be red for a good chunk of time.

Creating the link "Create Post", will get you past one line, but we will still be red.
Starting from scratch, we have no post controller, and no post model.

We are now on the outside, stepping *in*.

We continue to create our Post controller and write our controller spec:

``` ruby
describe "when logged in" do
  it "POST#create" do
    title = Faker::Lorem.word
    content = Faker::Lorem.paragraph
    expect {
      post :create, post: { title: title, content: content }
      assigns(:post).should_not be_nil
    }.to change { Post.count }.by(1)
  end
end
```

We begin the implementation of the controller only to find that we now must create the `Post` model in order to be green.

We continue to create our Post model and then write our model spec:

```ruby
describe Post do
  describe "associations" do
    it { should belong_to :user }
  end
  describe "validations" do
    it { should validate_presence_of :content }
    it { should validate_presence_of :title }
    it { should validate_presence_of :user_id }
  end
end
```

Now that we are at the bottom of our stack, we can start implementing functionality in its entirety and make our tests go green, starting with our `Post` model:

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user

  validates_presence_of :content
  validates_presence_of :user_id
  validates_presence_of :title
end
```

With our model implemented, we can complete our `PostsController` implementation:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :authenticate_user!
  ...

  def create
    @post = Post.create!(params[:post].merge( { user: current_user } ))
    redirect_to post_path(@post)
  end
end
```

And with our controller spec green, we now flesh out our views to have our request spec pass and ultimately complete this iteration of `Outside-in` testing.

`posts/new.html.haml`

```haml
= simple_form_for @post do |f|
  = f.input :title
  = f.input :content
  = f.submit
```

`posts/show.html.haml`

```haml
%h1 Title
.title= @post.title

%h3 Content
.content= @post.content

= link_to "see posts", posts_path
```

And finally, we're green:

```
$ rake
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence "posts_id_seq" for serial column "posts.id"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "posts_pkey" for table "posts"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence "users_id_seq" for serial column "users.id"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "users_pkey" for table "users"
  12/12:       100% |==========================================| Time: 00:00:00

Finished in 0.72055 seconds
