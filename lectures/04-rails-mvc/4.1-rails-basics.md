Rails Basics
============

Rails can generate a working rails application in a single command.

    $ rails new hello-world

An application can then be run.

    $ cd hello-world
    hello-world$ rails s

    => Booting WEBrick
    => Rails 3.2.3 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
    => Call with -d to detach
    => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
    [2011-12-07 16:29:35] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
    [2011-12-07 16:29:35] INFO  ruby 1.9.2 (2011-07-09) [x86_64-darwin11.2.0]
    [2011-12-07 16:29:35] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=20070 port=3000

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your rails application.

You can also open a rails console with `rails c`.

That's too easy. Let's build a bare bones Rails application that can serve static pages, first. 

Bundler
-------

Create a *Gemfile* with the following contents.

``` ruby
source "http://rubygems.org"

gem "rails", "3.2"
```

Install gems.

    $ bundle install
    Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.

    $ rails --version
    Rails 3.2.3

Boot
----

In *config/boot.rb* we just need to setup bundler to load our gems.

``` ruby
# require rubygems that knows how to load gems
require 'rubygems'

# require bundler, which in turn will load all the gems
require 'bundler/setup'
```

Application
-----------

An application is declared in *config/application.rb*.

``` ruby
# load libraries required on boot
require File.expand_path('../boot', __FILE__)

# the action controller that serves requests
require "action_controller/railtie"

# libraries required for the application to run
# include :default and current environment libraries
Bundler.require :default, Rails.env

# application itself
module HelloWorld
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Configure the default encoding used in templates for Ruby 1.9.
    config.encoding = "utf-8"
  end
end
```

Environment
-----------

Initialize the application with all its environment options in *config/environment.rb*.

``` ruby
require File.expand_path('../application', __FILE__)

HelloWorld::Application.initialize!
```

Config.ru
---------

Rails uses Rack as the basis for its HTTP handling.

Config.ru is a convention by which we indicate how to run a Rack-based application. This is also called to *rack-up* an application.

``` ruby
require ::File.expand_path('../config/environment',  __FILE__)

run HelloWorld::Application
```

A call to `File.expand_path('../config/environment',  __FILE__)` evaluates to an absolute path to `config/environment`. This enables running Rails applications from any location.

Script/rails
------------

Script/rails is automatically run when you type `rails`. It loads `config/application.rb` and `config/boot.rb`.

``` ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

APP_PATH = File.expand_path('../../config/application',  __FILE__)

require File.expand_path('../../config/boot',  __FILE__)
require 'rails/commands'
```

Cryptographic Token
-------------------

A secret token is required to encrypt session data. Add *config/initializers/secret_token.rb*.

``` ruby
HelloWorld::Application.config.secret_token = "why did the chicken cross the road?"
```

Static HTML Page
----------------

Add *public/index.html* with some basic HTML content.

Run the Application
-------------------

    $ rails s

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to display the contents of index.html.

Load Sequence
-------------

    $ rails s

    Loading script/rails
    Loading config/boot.rb
    Loading rails/commands
    Loading application.rb
    => Booting WEBrick
    => Rails 3.2.3 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
    => Call with -d to detach
    => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
    Loading config.ru
    Loading config/environment.rb
    HelloWorld::Application.initialize!
    Loading config/routes.rb
    Running HelloWorld::Application
    [2011-12-07 17:24:35] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
    [2011-12-07 17:24:35] INFO  ruby 1.9.2 (2011-07-09) [x86_64-darwin11.2.0]
    [2011-12-07 17:24:35] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=20322 port=3000

Lets look at a [Rails MVC application](4.2-rails-mvc-scaffold.md).
